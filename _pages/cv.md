TEACHING

Above all, I want my students to enjoy learning the topic. As long as the learning process leaves a long-lasting and positive impression on the topic and the university, then they will continue to learn. I firmly believe my enthusiasm for the topics I teach relays that message. Teaching dossier available upon request.
